Before starting scanning, enter ip host or range.

  - Example of a single host: 123.123.123.123
  - Example of the ip range for scanning: 123.123.123.122 - 123.123.123.124
    (elements of the range will be [123.123.123.122, 123.123.123.123, 123.123.123.124] )

After selecting the ports to scan:
1. range ports
